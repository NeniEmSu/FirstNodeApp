# My first go at a Node.js app with express

In this repo i created a basic node app from scratch, and added a templeate to begin a set with node.

## I learnt 
1. The basic principles of node and express 
2. The structure of a node app
3. How to make routes, view, and static/public/ assets, 
4. Learnt to connect then to static assets.

### My thoughts 
I really like the workings of node and express and would put more time to learnig the compexities of this language for my fullstack path.
